In this prompt, both the CLIP and CLIP version tried to make the giraffe more normal, instead of read and none of them show a brown car, only red cars.
But the normal stable diffusion turbo did manage to show a giraffe and a brown car (and also a red car), so the normal version is the best.
The reason could be that the VLMs (both CLIP and BLIP) don't recognize red giraffes as girrafes, and as a result, ReNO tries to make the giraffe look more normal. Another reason could be that this is simply accidental and other seeds might make the optimized versions better.

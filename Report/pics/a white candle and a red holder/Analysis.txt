The normal version has a white candle on a red holder, so it fulfilled the prompt. But ReNO trying to optimize it made it worse by trying to turn the single candle into several. The reason could be overfitting, since the original noise matrix could have been turned into a good image, the extra iterations of trying to have a lower distance with the text features of the VLM, may have caused overfitting.

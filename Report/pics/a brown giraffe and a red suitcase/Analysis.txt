Normal: Shows a small giraffe with an unrealistically big head with a big giraffe and 2 red suitcases.
BLIP: shows a normal and a baby giraffe that are more brown than normal next to 2 red suitcases.
CLIP: shows a huge giraffe that somehow has one of its legs connected to one of the suitcases, making it look unrealistic.

Based on the descriptions, all of them managed to show the objects in the prompt, but BLIP had the most realistic version.

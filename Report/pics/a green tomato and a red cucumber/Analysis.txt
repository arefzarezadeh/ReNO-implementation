None of them show a cucumber, let alone a red cucumber. Instead they all have a green pumpkin-like fruit and a weird dark green fruit and a read tomato, with CLIP being the only one having a half-red and half-green tomato.

Although none of the images are close to the prompt, the CLIP version performed slightly better.

All 3 show a black woman with white clothes instead of a woman with a black shirt and a white vest. All 3 versions have them woman hold a camera and looking into a mirror. None of the images look realistic, the normal one shows the hand holding the camera weirdly, the BLIP version doesn't show the reflection of the woman, and the CLIP version shows an extra hand holding the camera in the reflection.

None of the images are very similar to the prompt or are realistic. Not being able to be close to the prompt could be because the prompt is very long with several objects and adjectives, making parsing them into image features quite complicated. Not being realistic could becaues of involvement of holding a camera, which has several details like fingers, their position, etc making it difficult, and also having a mirror, because showing a reflection is quite complicated and requires thinking, which the models cannot properly do.

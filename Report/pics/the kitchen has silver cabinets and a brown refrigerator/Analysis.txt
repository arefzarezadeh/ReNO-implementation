Normal: shows a kitchen with brown cabinets and 2 silver refrigerators, instead of the other way around.
BLIP: Still has silver refrigerator, but tries to make the cabinets having a more metalic look to them, while still being brown.
CLIP: Similar to the normal version, but has a fridge on brown cabinets, trying to making it closer to the prompt.

Although none of them show silver cabinets or brown refrigerator, the BLIP version performed the best, by trying to make the cabinets look more metalic.
